# Survivor Services

## Contains a Survivor API.
    * Has all the contestants names along with their age, season, living location and finish
    * Also has one for the season that shows the month and year that the season came out
    
## Problems
1) Got it to read the omdb information but could not figure out how to write it to the page
2) Whenever trying to change the bootstrap I would make my whole working service stop working. So it is not changed completely
